# C basics

In this project we will create four basic functions.

1.isStrong. Strong number is a special number whose sum of the factorial of digits is equal to the original
number. For Example: 145 is strong number

2.isPrime will return true if a number is prime number false otherwise.

3.isPalindrome will return true if a number is palindrome false otherwise.

4.isArmstrong will return if a number is Armstrong number
An Armstrong number is an n-digit number that is equal to the sum of the nth powers of its digits.
For Example: 407 = 43 + 03 + 73 = 64 + 0 + 343 = 407

```
git clone
```
Use the make file
```
make all
```
Then choose from the options
mains
maindrec
maindloop
All will require you entering a number.
mains will check if a number is prime and strong
maindrec and maindloop will check if a number is a palindrome and armstrong

```
