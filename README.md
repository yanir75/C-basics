# C basics

In this project we will create four basic functions.

1. isStrong. Strong number is a special number whose sum of the factorial of digits is equal to the original
number. For Example: 145 is strong number

2.isPrime will return true if a number is prime number false otherwise.

3.isPalindrome will return true if a number is palindrome false otherwise.

4.isArmstrong will return if a number is Armstrong number
An Armstrong number is an n-digit number that is equal to the sum of the nth powers of its digits.
For Example: 407 = 43 + 03 + 73 = 64 + 0 + 343 = 407
